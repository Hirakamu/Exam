      "pertanyaan": "The following text is for questions 12 to 15!\nRecycling is a simply process of converting the waste materials into the new materials and also objects. To do this, recycling often requires both machinery andemployees to correctly sort recyclable items based on the material they're made of. This includes paper, plastic, glass, metal, and more. I tis very importance to do this to keep the natural resources and for the future generations.Here some reasons why we should do recycling.\nWhen we recycle,we lessen disruption to the natural world. When we cut down fewver trees and forests, we are preventing harm to animals. By reducing disruption and damage to the natural world,we help preserve ecosystems and wildlife.\nSome of the world's natural resources are in short supply, and when we recycle, we help conserve these natural resources. When we recycle paper, we save forests and trees. When we recycle plastic,it takes up a lot of solid waste and can take centuries to break down. In addition to this,most plastic comes from fossil fuel hydrocarbons. Recycling metals reduces the need to extract new metal ore while recycling glass reduces our need for certain raw materials like sand.\nMaking products from recycled materials requires less energy than making them from new,raw materials. It takes much less energy to make products out of recycled materials than from raw materials. For example, recycling one glass bottle saves enough power to light a 100-watt light bulb for four hours.\nWhen we recycle, it reduces our need to harvest raw materials. Our increasing demand for these raw materials also displaces people who live near forests or around river systems. When we recycle,we reduce the possibility of damaging someone else's land or community.\nRecycling takes up less energy, which reduces our carbon footprint and emissions. Reducing our carbon footprint helps minimize methane-release waste from landfill sites, which contributes to climate change. Recycling waste is much cheaper than regular waste collection and disposal. The more we recycle, the more money we can save. Deposit returns can also help add financial incentives to recycle. Recycling can help protect the environment while conserving natural resources. It is critical to recycle and minimize the amount of waste we are putting into the atmosphere.Doing so can help save energy,reduce landfill waste, and protect our environment.\nRecycling brings communities together and helps people raise money for schools, colleges,hospitals, and more. These recycling drives make towns and cities happier and cleaner.\nWhen communities come together to raise awareness about recycling, it teaches people about the importance of protecting the environment and how to do so. Educating people about protecting the environment can help equip future generations with the knowledge and understanding they need to reduce pollution.\nRecycling creates new jobs every year. Jobs in recycling include sorters, drivers, mechanics,technicians, and more. When we recycle, we reprocess materials to make new products, reducing the amount of waste sent for incineration.\nIn simple words, recycling is essential to our natural environment, human. And all aspect of life.\nAdapted from:https: //northhillbottledepot.ca/why-is-recycling-important-10-benefits-of-recycling/\n 12. What is the main idea of paragraph three?\n    ",
